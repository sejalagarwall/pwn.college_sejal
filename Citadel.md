# Citadel

## Zahard's Welcome
The base of Citadel rises before you, its great doors sealed with fractured steel and dead circuitry.
Faded corporate protocols still hum in the lock, relics of the world that fell.

Those who came before tried to climb but all failed. Their echoes linger as fragments of voices, reminders of broken attempts to free humanity.
Now you have chosen to take their place. You will be the one to scale the Citadel and finish what they could not.

The voices of the fallen whisper through the static: "The path begins in the gathering place. There, candidates are chosen". Here is your invitation.

Step into the gathering place where all climbers are briefed before the ascent.

I searched for the flag in the discord server. I found it in the description of the rules channel.

üóºOSINT pt1: The ascent begins. The first floor is not metal or binaries but of memory.
Among the echoes, one voice lingers, of an early climber.
He was among the earliest to challenge the Citadel, and though he failed, his traces remain scattered across the ruins of the old world.

It is said that the key to the next floor can be found by tracing the socials of this legendary climber.

Start by checking out citadweller on Instagram.

I found the flag in the highlight of the instagram account citadweller.

## track 8
Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn.
On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it

When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world,
and you recognize it as a song from Panchiko‚Äôs latest studio album,
particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher.
Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.

### Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{add_vinegar_twice}`

I looked up panchiko's latest album 'gingko' and saw that track 8 was named 'vinegar'. I deciphered the text using vinegar cipher text and 'gingko' as the key.
I got the flag then by using 'panchiko' as the key.

## Omniscient Flag's Metadata
As you step into the second chamber, a figure manifests before you. Before you stands a forgotten deity, a dead god spoken of only in whispers. Known by countless names: ‚ÄúApostle of Epilogue and Eternity,‚Äù ‚ÄúLone Messiah‚Äù and many more lost to time.

They leave nothing but a single image, a relic carrying his final secret. Hidden within its layers lies the key to ascend to the next chamber.
