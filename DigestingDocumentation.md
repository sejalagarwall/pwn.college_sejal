# Digesting Documentation

## Learning from documentation
The typical need you'll have for documentation is just to figure out how to use all these dang programs, and a specific case of that is figuring out what arguments to specify on the command line. This module will mostly dig into that concept, as a proxy for figuring out how to use the programs in general. Through the rest of the module, you'll go through various ways of asking the environment for help for the programs, but first, we'll dig into the concept of reading documentation.

The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, on the proper specification of arguments to them. Recall the -a of ls -a in the hidden files challenge of the Basic Commands module: that -a was an argument that told ls to list out hidden files as well as non-hidden files. Because we wanted to list out hidden files, invoking ls with the -a argument was the correct way to use it in our scenario.

The program for this challenge is /challenge/challenge, and you'll need to invoke it properly in order for it to give you the flag. Let's pretend that this is its documentation:

Welcome to the documentation for /challenge/challenge! To properly run this program, you will need to pass it the argument of --giveflag. Good luck!

Given that knowledge, go get the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UiDKGgbyZNo70AQNNMjJzffUHFd.QX0ITO0wCN2gjNzEzW}`

I followed the given directions and properly used arguments to obtain the flag.
```
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UiDKGgbyZNo70AQNNMjJzffUHFd.QX0ITO0wCN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt that we can use the environment to help us use programs. An arguement is one example that needs documentation.

## Learning complex usage
While using most commands is straightforward, the usage of some commands can get quite complex. For example, the arguments to commands like sed and awk, which we're definitely not getting into right now, are entire programs in an esoteric programming language! Somewhere on the spectrum between cd and awk are commands that take arguments to their arguments...

This sounds crazy, but you've already encountered this with the find level in Basic Commands. find has a -name argument, and the -name argument itself takes an argument specifying the name to search for. Many other commands are analogous.

Here is this level's documentation for /challenge/challenge:

Welcome to the documentation for /challenge/challenge! This program allows you to print arbitrary files to the terminal, when given the --printfile argument. The argument to the --printfile argument is the path of the flag to read. For example, /challenge/challenge --printfile /challenge/DESCRIPTION.md will print out the description of the level!

Given that documentation, go get the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{A2H3gx-3AO-jM6iFQv283qVMD7H.QX1ITO0wCN2gjNzEzW}`

I got stuck at the file name where the flag is stored. After a few tries I got that it is stored in /flag like it always is. I obtained the flag using proper arguments with the /challenge/challenge program.
```
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{A2H3gx-3AO-jM6iFQv283qVMD7H.QX1ITO0wCN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt about arguments inside arguments and how they are used. One example was the find command I previously learnt.

## Reading manuals
This level introduces the man command. man is short for manual, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument. For example, let's say we wanted to learn about the yes command (yes, this is a real command):

hacker@dojo:\~$ man yes
This will display the manual page for yes, which will look something like this:

YES(1)                           User Commands                          YES(1)

NAME
       yes - output a string repeatedly until killed

SYNOPSIS
       yes [STRING]...
       yes OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Repeatedly output a line with all specified STRING(s), or 'y'.
	   --help display this help and exit
	   --version
              output version information and exit

GNU coreutils 8.32               February 2022                          YES(1)
The important sections are:

NAME(1)                           CATEGORY                          NAME(1)

NAME
	This gives the name (and short description) of the command or
	concept discussed by the page.

SYNOPSIS
	This gives a short usage synopsis. These synopses have a standard
	format. Typically, each line is a different valid invocation of the
	command, and the lines can be read as:
	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] SINGLE_MANDATORY_ARGUMENT
	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] MULTIPLE_ARGUMENTS...

DESCRIPTION
	Details of the command or concept, with detailed descriptions
	of the various options.

SEE ALSO
	Other man pages or online resources that might be useful.

COLLECTION                        DATE                          NAME(1)
You can scroll around the manpage with your arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn. When you're done reading the manpage, you can hit q to quit.

Manpages are stored in a centralized database. If you're curious, this database lives in the /usr/share/man directory, but you never need to interact with it directly: you just query it using the man command. The arguments to the man command aren't file paths, but just the names of the entries themselves (e.g., you run man yes to look up the yes manpage, rather than man /usr/bin/yes, which would be the actual path to the yes program but would result in man displaying garbage).

The challenge in this level has a secret option that, when you use it, will cause the challenge to print the flag. You must learn this option through the man page for challenge!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0Vwaw0ZFMtXQnMYEa5m5bqgC7dR.QX0EDO0wCN2gjNzEzW}`

I used the man command to access the manual for the challenge command. The manual described --wawtna with 005 needed as an argument to print the flag. Therefore, I ran the program with that as the argument.
```
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --wawtna 005
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{0Vwaw0ZFMtXQnMYEa5m5bqgC7dR.QX0EDO0wCN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt about the man command and that there is a manual for every command in the database.

## Searching manuals
You can scroll man pages with the arrow keys (and PgUp/PgDn) and search with /. After searching, you can hit n to go to the next result and N to go to the previous result. Instead of /, you can use ? to search backwards!

Find the option that will give you the flag by reading the challenge man page.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{syuZTkfVgIeyf0F00ZkTxvcMtuy.QX1EDO0wCN2gjNzEzW}`

I used / to search the manual for 'flag' and used the 'n' key to navigate through the results until I found the right one.
```
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --uzi
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{syuZTkfVgIeyf0F00ZkTxvcMtuy.QX1EDO0wCN2gjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I learnt how to navigate and search through a manual.
